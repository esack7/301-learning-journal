# Day 13
## Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

Today we learned about deploying our websites to heroku.  The process seems a bit complicated, but I know once I start using the process more and more, it will be as common place as ACP.  I am excited about getting started on projects.

Lecture Notes:

To change process.env use "export"

export GITHUB_TOKEN='8888888888888888888888'

echo GITHUB_TOKEN will return the token

This is a temporary variable.

In BASH_RC --> export GITHUB_TOKEN '88888888888888888888888'

echo 'node_modules/' >> .gitignore

# Day 15
## Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

Today was our prep day for project week starting next Monday. I am excited about my team that I was assigned to.  Shaun, Gavin and Kimmer seem like a great team to part of.  During our planning time we came up with the idea of doing a Netflix app that give the user a suggestion of a Netflix movie or tv show to watch.  Unfortunately, Netflix doesn't have an open API, but we found some alternatives, so I think it will turn out nicely.

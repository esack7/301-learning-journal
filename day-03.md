# Day 3
## Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

This starting week in 301 has been quite an ordeal.  On a positive note, I feel like the subject matter is really building on what we learned in 201 and things like jQuery make it quite exciting. On a note, that at least for the moment doesn't feel positive, the pace is just so very accerlerated and I am having a hard time believing I will be able to keep up.  I have been having a hard time getting my assignments, labs, and portfolio done or at least done with quality.  Hopefully, I hit one of those break through moments in the near future.

I am still very excited about this class and all the things I am going to learn and what that will mean for my future!

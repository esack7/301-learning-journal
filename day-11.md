Today we did code review by going through the lab from the day before, which was very helpful because I had a hard time understanding that lab.  Then we did code Demo on the single page application using page.js and history api.  I didn't understand this content very well, but I completed the lab with my partner before the end of the day and that really helped me understand the content.

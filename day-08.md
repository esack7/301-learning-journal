# Day 8
## Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

We've started delving into the 'backend' in the last couple days. It's exciting to start to learn things like express.js, sql, node.js and npm.  I feel like the hardest part for me is understanding the syntax on the server and what is referencing what.  I am hoping that this will start to sink in.  I really struggled on this last lab answering the questions about what the code on server.js says.

Notes from day 8:

HTTP -->
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE

CRUD - CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DESTROY

SQL - LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES A WAY TO INTERACT WITH A RELATIONAL DB

Postgres - a type of Relational Database

Semi-colon's are absolutely required at the end of a SQL statement.

Start postgres in Ubuntu --> sudo -u postgres psql postgres

#Day 1
##Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

The first day of 301 was a bit strange for me.  I think mostly because the scheduled was different than I was expecting, given that this class has afternoon lecture.  I am over it and mentally prepared for that going forward, but I wasn't expecting that and it came as a bit of a shock the first day.

I am excited about this class.  It's great having known most of my classmates from 201, so it definitely didn't feel weird.  Maybe it's having taken the last week off, but the subject matter seemed a bit confusing to me.  I think I get the basic concept of MVC as it paints for me a clearer picture of what 'full-stack' really means.  I havent totally wrapped my brain around media queries as it applys to RWD. Mostly the syntax, but I think that will come.

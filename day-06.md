# Day 6
## Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal

Today we learned about AJAX and API's and reviewed JSON.  It's exciting to see the be delving into the backend things! Today's discussion before lecture where some of the more vocal people in class voiced their concerns about the some of the differences and changes of this class from the last 201 was somewhat uncomfortable, but probably necessary.  I hope that we can done with that discourse for now, at least in the classroom.

Notes from class:

highlight.js is what renders code in html.

marked.js allows you to use ``` to display code.

<input> with property of 'name' is necessary for screen readers.

<input readonly> an input field that is read only.  Can't edit or change.

*AJAX*

JSON - is the universal language between front-end and back-end.

jQuery Ajax request -

$.get('https://swapi.co/people/5')
	.done( ){
	}
	.fail() {
	}
	.always() {
	}
